\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The results of the discussed work show that the GDPR had a global impact on privacy control. It helps users be more
informed about privacy and gives them more control especially through third-party opt-out services. On the other hand
the results propose that current state of tracking is still far from the desired behavior. Many websites do not follow
the GDPR by tracking without consent (more than 90\% of the larger websites) and making cookie consent notices intentionally complicated. There is still
work to be done on the topic through new regulations and better technical means for detecting violations or better
technical means for opting-out.
