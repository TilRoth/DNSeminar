On May 25th, 2018 the \emph{General Data Protection Regulation}(GDPR) was applied by the European Union. The GDPR is
supposed to provide users the means to protect their privacy on the internet. This also strongly limits the ability of
websites to track users via cookies. This report is based on the work of
\citeauthor{sanchez2019can}~\cite{sanchez2019can} who evaluate the impact of the GDPR on cookie
tracking of users on a global scale. Furthermore, \citeauthor{sanchez2019can} present the impact of the GDPR on privacy
policies of websites.
