\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

In this section we briefly highlight some limitations of the underlying work.

In \autoref{subsec:methodology} we talk about the methodology of \ca{sanchez2019can}. They perform a manual analysis of
the websites in their target list. A drawback of this method is that specific metrics like the waiting time until you
decline the cookies or the waiting time until you reload the page after declining cannot be captured by manual analysis.

In \autoref{subsec:eval} we show the results of the underlying work~\cite{sanchez2019can}.
A critique point here is that the evaluation of \ca{sanchez2019can} is lacking a proper comparison of the time before
the GDPR and the time after. They only show their results in a post GDPR world leading to some statements being out of
context (e.g. There are no numbers on how many cookie consent notices there were in the EU before the GDPR).
